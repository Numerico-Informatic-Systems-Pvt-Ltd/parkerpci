During his career, he has investigated over 350 death investigations that have involved murder-for-hire, suicides, accidental and natural death.\r\n\r\nNumerous investigations have been conducted on child abuse, armed robbery, aggravated assault and battery, sexual assault, police officer "use of force" and embezzlement. He has also worked with many federal agencies such as the FBI, ATF and DEA. Parker has been qualified as an expert witness in several fields concerning criminal justice topics such as interviews and interrogations, search and seizure, and narcotics investigations.

Deaths can result from the use of physical and mechanical restraints that were improperly used, use of chemical sprays such as pepper sprays, improper arrest techniques and weapons. These cases are also important because they usually involve both criminal matters as it relates to the officer involved and civil litigation as it relates to the victim. Usually these cases are also investigated by the FBI as to civil rights violations on behalf of he victim.\r\n\r\nParker Investigations has investigated numerous “Use of Force” cases as a former Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent that involved many different law enforcement agencies. These cases require the interviewing of all witnesses, review of department policies and procedures, knowledge of state law and recent court rulings, examination of the scene through photographs and videos and review of the officers past performances / complaints / disciplinary history.\r\n\r\nDetailed reports by Parker Investigations will document all of the investigative actions and a final “opinion” will be rendered based on the information gained from the investigation.

A complete background investigation can provide a corporation with a detailed report that would include interviews with previous employers/co-workers, financial and criminal history, interviews with references and unsolicited references, social media searches, interviews with neighbors and checks with local law enforcement agencies concerning the applicant.\r\n\r\nWe have experience with background investigations for employees for law enforcement agencies, corporations and State of Georgia political apointees.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="span5"><a href="http://parker.nisclient.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Background-checks.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-136 size-large" src="http://parker.nisclient.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Background-checks-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="438" /></a></div>\r\n<div class="clearfix"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 'Background Investigations', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'background-investigations', '', '', '2015-04-07 13:16:48', '2015-04-07 13:16:48', '', 0, 'http://parkerinvestigation.local/?page_id=13', 0, 'page', '', 0),

These types of investigations arise from many different issues such as policy and procedure violations, allegations of misconduct by employees and complaints from citizens. City municipalities, county governments and corporations can resolve specific issues that may or may not rise to the level of a criminal investigation that would involve law enforcement. These issues can be resolved through many different investigative techniques such as interviews, polygraphs and questionnaires. Thefts of assets within corporations are always a concern for management. Depending on the size of the company and the number of employees that have access to certain assets, the number of suspects may be quite large. Polygraphs can be very expensive so other methods are employed to narrow down the scope of the investigation. Parker Investigations utilizes every available technique to properly and efficiently resolve the issue. All of the findings are well documented and provided to management for review and to develop a course of action to develop safeguards for the future.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="span5"><a href="http://parkerproject.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/criminal_top.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-55" src="http://parkerproject.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/criminal_top-300x199.jpg" alt="criminal_top" width="300" height="199" /></a></div>\r\n<div class="clearfix"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n <div class="row">\r\n        	<div class="inner_mid_wrap">\r\n            	<div class="span12">\r\n                    <h2>\r\n                        We have developed security plans for large corporations, school systems and private individuals\r\n                        <span>comprehensive security plan includes:</span>\r\n                    </h2>\r\n                    \r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>Review of current video system- location of cameras, type of camera utilized, storage of information (cloud based, DVR, capacity), security of stored information.</li>\r\n                        <li>Review key access system.</li>\r\n                        <li>Review exterior and interior physical security- locks, access points, structural barriers.</li>\r\n                        <li>Review of infra structure, security of: heating and cooling units, power, water.</li>\r\n                        <li>Review of emergency evacuation procedures in the event of: bomb threats, barricaded gunman, irate customers and/or spouses and relatives of employees, active shooter.</li>\r\n                        <li>Review of hiring procedures: application forms, background checks/investigations, polygraphs.

During his career, he has investigated over 350 death investigations that have involved murder-for-hire, suicides, accidental and natural death.\r\n\r\nNumerous investigations have been conducted on child abuse, armed robbery, aggravated assault and battery, sexual assault, police officer â€œuse of forceâ€ and embezzlement.

In some instances, private investigators have never worked in law enforcement. J. Douglas Parker retired from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation with 30 years of experience. During his career, he has investigated over 350 death investigations that have involved murder-for-hire, suicides, accidental and natural death.\r\n\r\nNumerous investigations have been conducted on child abuse, armed robbery, aggravated assault and battery, sexual assault, police officer â€œuse of forceâ€ and embezzlement. He has also worked with many federal agencies such as the FBI, ATF and DEA. Parker has been qualified as an expert witness in several fields concerning criminal justice topics such as interviews and interrogations, search and seizure, and narcotics investigations. This along with his specialized training in many different fields of crime scene examination, interviews and interrogations, evidence collection and statement analysis makes Parker one of the most experience private investigators in the southeast.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="span5"><a href="http://parker.nisclient.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Criminal-Investigation.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-130 size-large" src="http://parker.nisclient.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Criminal-Investigation-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="440" /></a></div>\r\n<div class="clearfix"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="inner_mid_wrap">\r\n<div class="span12">\r\n<h2>Important considerations when charged with a crime that\r\nmay need to be investigated further:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>How was the evidence collected?

Deaths can result from the use of physical and mechanical restraints that were improperly used, use of chemical sprays such as pepper sprays, improper arrest techniques and weapons. These cases are also important because they usually involve both criminal matters as it relates to the officer involved and civil litigation as it relates to the victim. Usually these cases are also investigated by the FBI as to civil rights violations on behalf of he victim.\r\n\r\nParker Investigations has investigated numerous “use of force” cases as a former Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent that involved many different law enforcement agencies. These cases require the interviewing of all witnesses, review of department policies and procedures, knowledge of state law and recent court rulings, examination of the scene through photographs and videos and review of the officers past performances / complaints / disciplinary history.\r\n\r\nDetailed reports by Parker Investigations will document all of the investigative actions and a final “opinion” will be rendered based on the information gained from the investigation.

He has also been trained in FEMA Active Shooter Response and was trained as a G.B.I. agent in Active Shooter First Responder. In 1999, he assisted in the 1999 investigation at the Heritage High School shooting in Conyers, GA. Parker was hired as a consultant for the McDuffie County Board of Education in Thomson, Georgia where he created a new department of public safety. This entailed the creation of a complete set of policies and procedures to be implemented by the department. A threat assessment was conducted on all buildings to include each school and stadium and an assessment was given with recommendations. He has also assisted Contemporary Services Corporation in security concerns at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. This training and past experiences allows him to conduct a complete threat assessment of schools and campuses to include the assessment of buildings, classrooms and policies within the school system. The assessment includes written recommendations, aerial photographs of the campus and a coordination plan with local law enforcement.\r\n<h2>DEATH <span>INVESTIGATIONS</span></h2>\r\nThe owner of Parker Investigations, J.

These investigations have involved the securing of search warrants in accordance with the 4th amendment, the processing and documentation of crime scenes and attending autopsies. Parker has interviewed in excess of 35,000 witnesses, victims and suspects in a vast array of cases from juvenile misdemeanors to felonies. He has been trained in nonverbal communication and statement analysis which coupled together can provide for an accurate assessment of witness, victim and suspect statements.\r\n<h2>UNDERCOVER <span>NARCOTICS</span></h2>\r\nParker has extensive experience in undercover narcotics investigations. He served as the Regional Narcotics Specialist investigating major level traffickers in state and federal jurisdictions. Through these undercover investigations, Parker has been trained in the most advanced technology and utilized undercover surveillance techniques.\r\n<h2>DIGNITARY <span>PROTECTION</span></h2>\r\nTrained by the Secret Service, Parker was assigned to numerous presidential and heads-of-state protection details. These details have included Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Jesse Jackson and heads-of-state from Austria, Cuba and other countries.

In some instances, private investigators have never worked in law enforcement. J. Douglas Parker retired from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation with 30 years of experience. During his career, he has investigated over 350 death investigations that have involved murder-for-hire, suicides, accidental and natural death.\r\n\r\nNumerous investigations have been conducted on child abuse, armed robbery, aggravated assault and battery, sexual assault, police officer "use of force" and embezzlement. He has also worked with many federal agencies such as the FBI, ATF and DEA. Parker has been qualified as an expert witness in several fields concerning criminal justice topics such as interviews and interrogations, search and seizure, and narcotics investigations. This along with his specialized training in many different fields of crime scene examination, interviews and interrogations, evidence collection and statement analysis makes Parker one of the most experience private investigators in the southeast.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="span5"><a href="http://parker.nisclient.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Criminal-Investigation.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-130 size-large" src="http://parker.nisclient.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Criminal-Investigation-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="440" /></a></div>\r\n<div class="clearfix"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="inner_mid_wrap">\r\n<div class="span12">\r\n<h2>Important considerations when charged with a crime that\r\nmay need to be investigated further:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>How was the evidence collected?

If you are on an online dating site, you need to know who you are about to meet and possibly get involved in a long term relationship. Knowing up front that the person has a checkered past with law enforcement or creditors can help you decide if you want to get involved with that person.\r\n\r\nIf you are the director of a human resource department charged with the hiring of new employees, you need to know who is being hired. A complete background investigation can provide a corporation with a detailed report that would include interviews with previous employers/co-workers, financial and criminal history, interviews with references and unsolicited references, social media searches, interviews with neighbors and checks with local law enforcement agencies concerning the applicant.\r\n\r\nWe have experience with background investigations for employees for law enforcement agencies, corporations and State of Georgia political apointees.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="span5"><a href="http://parker.nisclient.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Background-checks.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-136 size-large" src="http://parker.nisclient.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Background-checks-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="438" /></a></div>\r\n<div class="clearfix"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 'Background Investigations', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '13-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-07 13:16:48', '2015-04-07 13:16:48', '', 13, 'http://parker.nisclient.com/13-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
